title: "LBWebRTC Broadcast Suite"
description: |
  "Designed and developed a series of embedded Linux systems to manage and control live television broadcasts streams."
  "I made a custom build of Xubuntu which included a hefty software stack a a lot of automation, init and control scripts. That powered a custom Flutter desktop application that managed the broadcast streams by integrating with various bits of software and hardware."
