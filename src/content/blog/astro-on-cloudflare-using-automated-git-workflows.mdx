## Overview

Cloudflare Pages is a powerful platform for hosting static sites - edge caching, image manipulation, page rules and with some configuration, server-side rendering. If you're an Astro user, you can automate the build and deployment process using Git workflow automation. If your site is pure static, you can configure everything in just a few clicks.

If you site includes server-side rendered pages it's a bit more work to get things properly configured, but once set up it works flawlessly and the site's performance is blisteringly fast.

In this post I cover the process for automating both static and server-side rendered (hybrid) sites and highlight some of the gotchas I bumped into when setting this site up on Cloudflare Pages.

## Static, CSR and SSR

### Static

Static pages are built at build-time and as the name suggests, are static files that don't provide any iteractivity. Static content is lightning fast but not suited to content that changes. It's a good idea to generate as many static pages as possible to improve performance and reduce overhead & complexity.

### Server-Side Rendering

Each page is generated on the server on a per-request basis. This is most commonly used for sides that have dynamic content, such as ecommerce websites, sites where users log in, etc.

### Client-Side Rendering

Pages are generated in the browser using Javascript and can be updated in real time. This would typically be used where data is live-updated. A page that displays the current exchange rate would be a half-decent example of a use case for CSR.

### Which To Use?

Astro is geared towards content and in most cases the vast majority of pages can be generated ahead of time as static. However, most sites will often need to provide some degree of interactivity. One of the most common use cases is the processing of form data. If you want users to be able to fill in a contact form, as is the case for me on this site, you need to ensure that the form is able to send data and that data is processed accordingly.

For now, let's leave that one, annoying page to the side and let's concentrate on first getting a workflow to automatically build a static-only website and publish it on Cloudflare Pages using their free tier.

## Static-Only automation

I'll not cover creating an Astro site or initialising its Git repo. I'm assuming that a site already exists locally and is linked to a Github repo. With that in mind, you just have these steps to complete to get your site up and running on Cloudflare Pages:

1. Create a Pages project on Cloudflare
2. Authenticate Cloudflare's access to Github
3. Configure build preferences
4. Push code to repo

### Create a Pages Project on Cloudflare

> **NOTE:** Pages are configured at account level, not at domain or 'website' level. You'll find the option in your account dashboard under the 'Workers & Pages' node.

<div class="not-prose">
<LightBox src={cloudflarePagesDashboard}
  alt="Cloudflare Pages"
  width={300}
  class="my-4"
  caption="Cloudflare Pages dashboard showing the Workers & Pages section"
/>
</div>

### Authenticate GitHub

Enter the repo details, click add and you'll be whisked away to GitHub to authenticate Cloudflare via OAuth. Once complete, you'll be automatically returned to the Cloudflare dashboard where you can select the repository you want to deploy from.

### Configure Build Preferences

Set the build command. I use bun, so it's a nice simple `bun run build`. Cloudflare includes a framework preset for Astro which just changes it to `npm run build`.

<div class="not-prose">
<LightBox src={cloudflarePagesBuildPreferences}
  alt="Cloudflare build preferences"
  width={300}
  class="my-4"
  caption="Build preferences"
/>
</div>

### Push code

When configured via the Cloudflare dashboard, the trigger is set up automatically. All that's left to do is push the site to Github and observe the build process.

<div class="not-prose">
<LightBox src={cloudflarePagesBuildProcess}
  alt="Cloudflare build process"
  width={300}
  class="my-4"
  caption="Cloudflare dashboard showing an automated build"
/>
</div>

### Add Cloudflare Astro plugin

This step is optional if you're generating static content only. If you're using server-side rendering, you'll need to add the Cloudflare plugin.

```bash caption="Install Cloudflare Astro plugin"
npm install @astrojs/cloudflare
```

### Configure Git repository

There's very little involved in this step as Cloudflare now authenticates with GitHub and pulls the repository info over after you've granted permission. Simply select the repository you want to deploy from and you're good to go.

### Set up build and deployment settings

You need to select the package manager you use locally to ensure the package lock file is generated correctly. I use Bun, so for me it was `bun run build` as the build command using the main branch of the repository. The steps are pretty much identical for the other package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, etc.).

Select a push action as the trigger for the workflow so the site is redeployed each time a change is made.

### Push Astro code to repository

```bash caption="Push Astro code to repository"
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Astro site to Cloudflare Pages"
git push
```

You can watch the build process in the Cloudflare dashboard. You may find it fails to build even though it completes locally. I found I had to remove some files that were prefixed with an underscore (ignored by Astro) as it was trying to build them. After that you should able to access your site using the URL entered in the Cloudflare dashboard when you created the project.
