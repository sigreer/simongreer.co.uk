## Preface

cal.com is a booking management app that's open source at its core. It was known previously as Calendso, and their Github repo states "The open-source Calendly successor." From that you might think that Calendly is not around anymore and the development team evolved the project into cal.com. However, that's not the case - the projects have no relation to each other save for the fact that they are both booking management apps.

The app is very slick and modern. It's a Next.js app and with React and Tailwind on the frontend, tRPC as the API, and Prisma as the ORM which is powered by a Postgres DB. There's also mention of 'daily.co', which I'd never heard of before but it looks like it's only available for enterprise/SaaS customers as an integrated voice and video-conferencing solution.

However, the developer experienc (DX) is pretty poor and the tools at your disposal to self-host the app are really lacking. Getting a solid, production-ready build was a real challenge which was not helped by the documentation or mystifying base repo and examples. Anyway, once working it fits a gap that's been open for some time in the open source business apps space and it's definitely worth a look if you take want to allow customers to book meetings or appointments with you seamlessly.
