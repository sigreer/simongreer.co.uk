          I've spent the last seven or eight years as a consultant, systems engineer and software developer in the Linux &amp; open source space. The lines between these roles has progressively blurred over the last few years and as I've worked on some interesting and diverse projects with wide-ranging responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">
          Having spent much of my career concentrating on business growth and the nurturing of ideas, I'm acutely aware of how much of an overhead -- and an enabler, technology can be.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Most of my technical experience has been accrued in the startup, SMB and mid-market space where roles and responsibilities are varied and occassionally vague. I've worked extensively with enterprise systems but generally prefer the dynamics of smaller teams with less rigidity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">I'm up front and honest and value long-standing relationships over quick wins.
        </p>
      <p class="text-base mb-4">
        As a developer I have experience working with front and backend web apps using modern Javascript frameworks. I've also built apps for broadcast media using Flutter, CRM/ERP systems backed by PostgreSQL and Prisma; and cross-platform desktop apps using Tauri and Electron.
      </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">
       A larger part of my career has been spent as a systems engineer. Originally with remote access technologies (Citrix, RDP, etc.) and then into virtualisation with VMware. As I moved into the open source realm I spent much more time building networking, server and storage solutions with particular emphasis on TrueNAS, OPNsense, Nginx and Docker.
      </p>
              <p class="text-base mb-4">
                If you think you've got a project that might be suitable - let me know. I'm not interested in wasting anyone's time and will only take on projects that I have 100% confidence in completing. That being said, I'll always extend the courtesy of responding even if that means directing you somewhere else.
